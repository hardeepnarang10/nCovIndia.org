            "<p><strong>Vijay Mohan</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tribune News Service</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Chandigarh, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>From evaluating the technical parameters of missiles and explosives, Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) here has switched its expertise and in-house innovation to develop personal protective gear for the medical fraternity in the nationwide fight against COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>As many as 10,000 full face protective shields and 15 acrylic enclosures for examining infected persons are being produced by TBRL for the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education (PGIMER) here.</p>\r\n<p>\"The face shields are single use as well as multiple use type while the lntubation protective enclosure can be used multiple times,\" Dr Manjit Singh, Director TBRL said. \"We are making about a 100 face shields and 3-4 enclosures each day,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>An important Defence Research and Development Organisaltion (DRDO) establishment based in Chandigarh, TBRL is involved in development, production, processing and characterisation of different high explosive compositions, fragmentation studies of warheads, captive flight testing of bombs, missiles and airborne systems and ballistics evaluation of protective system like body armour, vehicle armour and helmets.</p>\r\n<p>The face shields are light weight and can be worn full day with comfort. Commonly available A-4 size transparency sheets used in overhead projectors are being used as visors while the holding frame is manufactured through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), commonly known as 3-D printing. Polylactic Acid filament, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane, was used for 3-D printing.</p>\r\n<p>The enclosures were requested by PGIMER's Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care to act as first level of protection for doctors and medical staff during the intubation of COVID-19 patients. This is a process in which a tube is inserted into the patient's mouth to keep the airway open so that the patient can be placed on a ventilator.</p>\r\n<p>Made of perspex sheets the transparent enclosure is a cuboid that covers the patient's face and upper chest, with two holes on one side through which a doctor has insert his arms to work. Medical professionals are at elevated levels of risk of infection as virus particles can become aerosolised during intubation.</p>\r\n<p>Mass production of the products is planned using injection moulding technique to expedite the process. Industrial partners are also being developed to meet the possible demands from neighbouring states. Being a research laboratory, in-house production in TBRL is limited.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Manjit said that TBRL is also making hand sanitizers for the Chandigarh Police using base compositions developed by the DRDO. The requirement is for 6,000 bottles of 500 ml and 1,200 bottles have already been supplied. TBRL was to get the sanitizers bottled from a commercial plant in Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, but the area has been sealed-off due to the death of an infected person. Alternate measures are being explored.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, TBRL is also acting as a facilitator for the procurement of bio-suits developed by another DRDO lab for use by health care service providers. A walk-through disinfection tunnel, which is placed at the entrance to a building or complex, is also being evaluated at TBRL. Developed by Research Center Imarat, Hyderabad, the tunnel is equipped with sensors to assess body parameters, air showers and disinfectant sprays. It has the potential of being deployed at any public place or office complex.</p>"

            "<p>Julio Ribeiro</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">He was only a boy, 14 or 15 years of age. On his back he carried his meagre belongings, just one change of clothes, perhaps two if he had earned enough to feed his fancy. It would surprise me if he did not possess a mobile phone! Every boy from UP or Bihar, MP or Rajasthan, who has come to the big cities as migrant labour, has to have a mobile to keep in touch with his family back home. That picture on TV will forever remain with me!</span></p>\r\n<p>The boy was weeping! He had just been caned by exasperated policemen whose one and only concern was to keep citizens off the streets. The boy hailed from the same social background and the same economic bracket as the policeman (before the policeman was recruited in the force). But that thought, even if did arise, would not deter the policeman from using his lathi on the boy!</p>\r\n<p>The thought process of a policeman would not cross the boundaries of the orders emanating from the very top. Modiji had requested every citizen to stay home. And at home he or she had to keep a social distance of 3 feet from other members of the family. The boy was not aware of Modiji's diktat. He only knew that the coronavirus had thrown him and other migrant labourers on the road without any shelter and without the means to earn his daily wage, half of which he sent home to his impecunious parents and the other half which he spent on keeping himself alive!</p>\r\n<p>For him and the other migrant labourers on the roads, egressing the city, it was Hobson's choice. They stayed on the roads and starved to death or they walked hundreds of kilometres to their villages to the security of the family where blood ties provided love and sympathy, which human beings crave even if that does not put food in their bellies.</p>\r\n<p>Such niceties are beyond the understanding of a policeman. If a sensitive police leader has failed to put such thoughts in his ears, emphasising instead the paramount duty of keeping citizens confined to their own homes to break corona's cycle, he is going to wield his lathi on the backs and legs of the poor labourers faced by death from starvation or from the virus.</p>\r\n<p>The picture of that boy crying after being assaulted for choosing not to die of starvation has forced Modiji to apologise to the migrant labourers, who for a pittance are the backbone of the construction industry, in particular. When Modiji advised us to stay indoors, we accepted his sage advice because like him we belong to the ranks of the haves and neither Modiji or his cohorts of advisers, nor we spared a thought for the unfortunate!</p>\r\n<p>The boys from UP and Bihar who provide the essential domestic help to the feudal and the nouveau riche in the city of Mumbai brought the reactions of this segment of our population to my notice in a tone and tenor that made me flinch. Why did Modiji have to spring this lockdown on us in the same manner as he did when he demonetised the 1,000 and 500 rupee notes? I explained the reasons. Then, in that case, why did he order the police to beat the poor labourers? Again, I explained that Modiji had, obviously, forgotten that only 'sahibs' possessed flats where they and their families could make themselves comfortable for three weeks. I said I would not hold Modiji guilty on this count because I, too, with my genuine concern for the poor, had not factored in this obvious outcome of the suddenly announced lockout.</p>\r\n<p>Incidentally, renovation of the exteriors of our society building was being done when the lockdown was announced. The boys staying on site were twiddling their thumbs. Some residents felt that they were a source of possible contamination and should be asked to leave. Wiser counsel prevailed and they were allowed to stay on till the contractor could move them to another of his sites not far away. The boys themselves wish to go home to Madhya Pradesh, but cannot.</p>\r\n<p>Modiji's intentions in declaring the lockdown were noble as well as necessary. Could his army of advisers not have anticipated this tragedy? Modiji had lost traction after the CAA and NRC was announced and the youth lost hope after the JNU incident. Now, the poor mdash; who had propelled him to office because of the houses and toilets he built for them, the direct money transfers he organised to eliminate the middlemen and the village roads he got constructed mdash; are shocked by the treatment meted out to their friends, who constitute the bulk of the migrant labour.</p>\r\n<p>It is not enough to merely apologise to the wronged. The problem is not an easy one to solve, I admit. But, as I said, Modiji has a vast reservoir of thinking men and women at his disposal. He should be able to find a solution that will at least partly compensate for the hard times these poor men have faced consequent to the lockdown.</p>"

He was isolated, and eight other officers were quarantined, the source said.</p>\r\n<p>Liaison Officer and Assistant Commandant of CRPF, P Raja, who had been quarantined after Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak was tested Covid-19 positive, also underwent a test and awaited results.</p>\r\n<p>The 200 CRPF personnel sent on home quarantine were traced to be in contact with Raja and further course of measures will be taken after test reports of Raja, officials in the force said. </p>\r\n<p>A senior official in the force said that everyone on the list, including the CRPF DG and Senior Security Advisor of MHA K Vijay Kumar, have been advised home quarantine or quarantine at CRPF facilities until their test reports came back. The official said they have not shown any symptoms of being infected.</p>\r\n<p>At least three Inspectors General, whose wards returned from foreign countries, have also been quarantined as a precautionary measure, as has former CRPF DG Vikram Srivastava, sources said.</p>\r\n<p>The CRPF chief, who is subjected to home quarantine, is overseeing the force's work from home. Maheshwari has so far shown no symptoms, officials said.</p>\r\n<p>A CRPF spokesperson said: \"A CRPF officer has tested positive for COVID-19. All personnel in contact with the officer have been quarantined. The DG CRPF had an indirect contact with the officer. As per protocol, DG is observing quarantine\".</p>\r\n<p>\"We will win together. The only Mantra is social distancing. To all of us let this be the religion as well as spirituality of the day. Save oneself to save others.

            "<p><strong>Karam Prakash</strong><br /><strong>Tribune News Service</strong><br /><strong>Patiala, April 4</strong></p>\r\n<p>The coronavirus death rate in Punjab is about 7.6 per centmdash;nearly three times higher than the national average of 2.75 per cent.</p>\r\n<p>The state reported a total of 65 cases until Saturday. Punjab does not have the highest number of cases, but its death rate is alarmingly among the highest.</p>\r\n<p>Among the most-affected states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadumdash;both have more than 400 casesmdash;the death rate is below 5 per cent.</p>\r\n<p>The higher percentage of death rate might be an indicator of the dwindling healthcare system in Punjab, warn experts.</p>\r\n<p>However, Dr Manjit Singh Bal, former head and professor of Government Medical College Patiala, said that age and immunity of the patient were major factors determining mortality.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"We have to consider the age-demographics and immunity level of the people in the respective area to get the exact reason for the high percentage of deaths from COVID-19 in Punjab.\"</p>\r\n<p>A 42-year-old Ludhiana woman is likely to have died due to the dwindling healthcare system. She was moved to Patiala Civil Hospital due to the lack of ventilators in Ludhiana. It took hours to reach Patiala and her condition deteriorated because she could not access the breathing equipment.</p>\r\n<p>Activist and former registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Dr Pyare Lal Garg, said the government had taken \"good\" measures but it should provide more powers to the Civil Surgeon instead to the Deputy Commissioner because \"we are admist a health crisis\".</p>\r\n<p>\"Civil Surgeon would have referred the patient to a private hospital in the Ludhiana immediately,\" said Garg.</p>\r\n<p>Punjab Health Minister, Balbir Singh Sidhu, said that three out of five deaths in the state were that of aged people. He said patients who died due to the virus had co-morbid conditions. Sidhu said that the other major factor was that cases were not diagnosed at an early stage. He said, \"Bhai Nirmal Singh came to the hospital very late. Similarly, the 42-year-old Ludhiana resident, who died at Patiala, was diagnosed with COVID-19 only in the last stage.\"</p>"

            "<p><strong>Lalit Mohan</strong><br><strong>Tribune News Service</strong><br><strong>Dharamsala, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>A man committed suicide on Sunday morning in Una district of Himachal Pradesh after villagers allegedly taunted him over the spread of coronavirus post the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi.</p>\r\n<p>Dilshad Muhamud hung himself from the roof of his house located at a hilltop in Bangarh village.</p>\r\n<p>The local police in-charge, Rakesh Kumar, who was present on the spot, said that Dilshad was taken by police to a regional hospital in Una on April 2 as he had come in contact with two persons who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation. He tested negative for coronavirus and was dropped off at his home on Saturday, in an ambulance, Kumar said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Muhamud belonged to the Gujjar community and was involved in dairy farming. His family belonged to Bangarh village, where most of the Gujjar community is involved in selling milk in adjoining areas of Punjab and in Una district. His family was listed as a BPL family by the Himachal government, as per the board painted outside his house.</p>\r\n<p>Muhamud's mother, Usha Devi, said that some villagers had insulted her son.</p>\r\n<p>\"Disturbed by the insults he committed suicide,\" she added</p>\r\n<p>Devi said that he met all family members on Sunday morning, offered namaz and then went inside a room. When he did not come out for long, the family members broke open the door and found him hanging.</p>\r\n<p>Muhamud's wife, Amardeep Kaur, also blamed villagers for insulting her husband. She was inconsolable and said that despite the fact that her husband tested negative for coronavirus, some villagers were out to victimize the family. They had also stopped taking milk from their family, she claimed. Kaur said selling milk was the family's only source of income. She maintained that her husband had never visited Delhi and had stayed at home--but was still harassed.</p>\r\n<p>Police in-charge of the region said a case would be registered after a post-mortem was performed on the body.</p>"

Total number of positive cases in Jamp;K now 106. Active cases in Kashmir-82 and Jammu -18,\" Jamp;K government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said in a tweet on Sunday.</p>\r\n<p>The cases include a 24-year-old youth from Bandipora with travel history to Bhopal and a woman from Sheer Check, Pakherpora, in Budgam district.</p>\r\n<p>The state has seen two deaths from the contagion so far.</p>\r\n<p>Jammu and Kashmir saw a major spike in infections on Saturday after 17 people were tested positive for the virus.</p>\r\n<p>Jammu and Kashmir administration has declared several dozen villages red and buffer zones after they reported multiple infections.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had a slow start for CoVID-19 testing and that is why positive cases were less. Now, we have started random testing in red zones and we fear number will rise drastically,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>Official records say Health Services Kashmir (HSK) took 120 samples for testing on Saturday against the routine 50 samples.</p>\r\n<p>\"Today, our sample collecting will go up to 150,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have doubled the sample collection for testing. Unless we carry out wide spread testing, we won't be able to fight this deadly disease,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>HSK has trained 52 laboratory technicians for collection of samples for testing of CoVID-19 suspected cases in red and buffer zones.</p>\r\n<p>\"This will ease out the burden of sample collection at centralized labs and enhance the number of test results per day,\" HSK said in a statement.</p>\r\n<p>According to HSK the samples collected in north Kashmir districts and Budgam will be sent for testing to Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) while as samples from South Kashmir and Srinagar will go to Chest Disease hospital Srinagar.</p>\r\n<p>Government spokesperson Rohit Kansal on Saturday said 1,397 samples were tested of which 1,250 were found negative while as 92 tested positive.</p>\r\n<p>Authorities are struggling to increase the testing capacities of the hospitals to cover maximum people tested for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease.</p>\r\n<p>Experts are pitching for utilisation of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) laboratories existing at different universities of Jammu and Kashmir to conduct more tests on a given day.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, Jamp;K is testing for SARS-CoV-2 at four places---Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) of Srinagar and Jammu, and Army's Command Hospital Udhampur.</p>\r\n<p>Public health experts said government needs to utilise labs in Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agriculture Sciences and Technology (SKUAST), Kashmir University, and other research institutes to expedite the testing.</p>\r\n<p>\"All these site in-charges (of research institutes) need to meet and workout how they can facilitate enhancing the testing capacity, either by supporting the existing lab with more equipment and manpower or starting at different locations within their institutions,\" said head of the community medicine GMC Srinagar Prof Muhammad Salim Khan.</p>\r\n<p>However, head of Chest Medicine department SKIMS, Dr Parvaiz Koul, cautioned that the RT-PCR labs in universities could not be used for SARS-CoV-2 testing unless biosafety measures are in place.</p>\r\n<p>\"You can't play with live virus unless you have adequate biosafety equipment for the testing staff. It is too dangerous. RT-PCR is available at many places but safety issues limit its utilisation,\" Koul said.</p>\r\n<p>Kansal said 28,545 persons, mostly those having travel history outside Jamp;K and having contact with suspect or positive CoVID-19 cases have been put under surveillance.</p>\r\n<p>At least 10,606 persons have been put in hospital quarantine and 12,795 in home quarantine while as 4,376 persons have completed their 28-day surveillance period, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The administration has asked religious leaders not to allow and carry any social ceremony including solemnizing marriage at religious places that can defeat the purpose of social distancing and make people vulnerable to CoVID-19.</p>"

            "<p>Washington, April 5</p>\r\n<p>President Donald Trump has said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the Hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in the country after India recently banned the drug for exports.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he spoke to Prime Minister Modi on Saturday morning and made a request to release Hydroxycholoroquine mdash; an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria mdash; for the US.</p>\r\n<p>\"I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of Hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,\" Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.</p>\r\n<p>India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 25 banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine but said that certain shipments on humanitarian grounds may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\n<p>With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he would appreciate if India releases the amount of Hydroxychloroquine that the US has ordered.</p>\r\n<p>\"And I said I would appreciate if they (India) would release the amounts that we ordered,\" he said, without mentioning that quantity of Hydroxychloroquine that has been ordered by US companies from India.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists across the world are racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus that has so far killed more than 64,000 people and infected 1.2 million in more than 150 countries.</p>\r\n<p>Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Following a quick provisional approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Saturday, the malaria drug along with a combination of some other drug is being used in the treatment of about 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York, the epicentre in the US.</p>\r\n<p>According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.</p>\r\n<p>In the next several weeks, health experts in the US have projected between 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, which due to human-to-human transmission is spreading like a wildfire in the country.</p>\r\n<p>In anticipation of it being a successful drug in the treatment of coronavirus, the US has already stockpiled some 29 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine.</p>\r\n<p>It is in this context Trump requested Modi to help US get millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that can be produced at mass scale in India.</p>\r\n<p>Prime Minister Modi on Saturday said he held a detailed discussion on the coronavirus crisis with President Trump and resolved to deploy the full strength of the Indo-US partnership to fight the global pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had a good discussion and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight COVID-19,\" Modi wrote on Twitter on his \"extensive\" telephonic conversation with Trump.</p>\r\n<p>The prime minister and the US president exchanged views on the pandemic and its impact on the global well-being and economy, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.</p>\r\n<p>Stressing on the special relationship between the two countries, Modi reiterated India's solidarity with the US in overcoming this global crisis together.</p>\r\n<p>\"The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19,\" the PMO said.</p>\r\n<p>Modi and Trump also exchanged notes on the steps taken in their countries for mitigating the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The two leaders also touched upon the significance of practices such as yoga and ayurveda for ensuring physical and mental well-being in these difficult times, the PMO statement said.</p>\r\n<p>They agreed that their officials would remain in close touch as regards the global health crisis, it added.</p>\r\n<p>Modi also conveyed deep condolences for the loss of lives in the US and his prayers for an early recovery of those still suffering from the disease.</p>\r\n<p>The discussion came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>\r\n<p>The Trump administration has made Hydroxychloroquine as part of its Strategic National Stockpile.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that people in malaria affected-countries take Hydroxychloroquine and not many people are infected by coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that he would take Hydroxychloroquine, if needed.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think people should if it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it, Ok? I may take it. And, I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it,\" he said in response to a question. PTI</p>"

After the issuance of these orders, the education department has regularly been warned schools of strict if they are found violating the order.</p>\r\n<p>\"But despite repeated instructions, there were reports about some schools which had been asking the parents to pay the fees of their children after the results. We have initiated strict action against La Foundation School, Sangrur, DAV Public School, Bhupindra Road Patiala, Bhupindra International School Patiala, Delhi Public School, Ludhiana, and Mount Litera Zee School, Faridkot,\" Singla told The Tribune.</p>\r\n<p>Singla said that the Ministry had decided that if it receives any complaint against a school in the future, first, it would get the school locked through a District Magistrate, then it would get an FIR registered against it, after which a reply would be sought from the school management. </p>\r\n<p>\"In all complaints till today, we have issued show-cause notices and given 7 days to file their reply against the violation. If they fail to give a satisfactory reply, we are going to cancel their affiliation or no objection certificate (NOC). But in future, first, we would get the school locked, file an FIR and then seek their replies,\" Singla said.</p>\r\n<p>He said that parents from all over the state could lodge complaints directly on his email: vijayindersingla@gmail.com</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>"

She said that you are a Muslim and you cannot be treated here. She asked another doctor to refer us to Jaipur,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I moved out of the hospital with my wife. My wife delivered in an ambulance and my baby died due to negligence of doctors,\" Khan said.</p>\r\n<p>He also alleged that he was being pressured to deny the discrimination charges to the panel probing the incident.</p>\r\n<p>Health Minister Subhash Garg said the matter is being investigated by a team of the district administration.</p>\r\n<p>\"I have asked the district collector to get the matter inquired. Action will be taken against whosoever is guilty. It is a painful incident,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>Without divulging much information about the case, Bharatpur's principal medical officer Navdeep Singh Saini said the matter is being investigated by a panel.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Tourism Minister Vishvendra Singh in a series of tweets blamed his own Congress government for suppressing the truth.</p>\r\n<p>\"It is clear from the videos that the government is trying to suppress the truth. I am cabinet minister and do not speak without proof. Please do not cover up,\" he said in a tweet tagging former state-cadre IAS officer Arvind Mayaram.</p>\r\n<p>In another tweet, Singh said, \"The Jamaat was/is a national disaster and hazard. But innocent Muslims suffering like this is painful. It does not mean that citizens of Islamic faith are treated the way a pregnant lady was handled by doctors in Bharatpur.\"  <strong>PTI</strong></p>"

            "<p><strong>Tribune News Service</strong><br /><strong>New Delhi, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>Suggesting it is time for every member of the society to exhibit total discipline and refrain from activities that can damage the collective effort to fight COVID-9, a senior official of India Islamic Cultural Centre urged religious leaders to appeal to people to not visit places of worship during the lockdown.</p>\r\n<p>\"The current situation is unprecedented. Tough times call for tough measures and this is exactly what our Prime Minister has done by ensuring a complete lockdown which was imperative to tackle this pandemic. I call upon all the stakeholders to show complete discipline and refrain from activities which can cause damage to our dedicated efforts,\" Vice President of the Centre, S M Khan, said in a statement on Sunday.</p>\r\n<p>Khan, who served as the Press Secretary to President APJ Abdul Kalam said the present time has shown that each individual has the inherent power to fight the common enemy together.</p>\r\n<p>The statement assumes significance post the Tablighi congregation that is said to have resulted in a spike in Coronavirus cases in the country.</p>\r\n<p>\"Natural disasters such as these do not discriminate between people in terms of religion, caste, creed, region etc. This phase should be a learning experience for all of us, how we can support each other for humanitarian causes. We all face this situation together and are fighting as ONE to overcome this problem at hand!\" Khan said.</p>\r\n<p>Khan said he hoped people will maintain camaraderie as in normal times so that everyone is able to fulfil the 'Idea of India'mdash;which is an inclusive society based on secularism, socialism, the dignity of human beings, unity and integrity of the nation.</p>\r\n<p>Making a special mention of all the essential service providers in ensuring continuity and business as usual so that people do not feel any difference during the lockdown, he said everyone should salute medical professionals who are taking care of those affected, police, administrative personnel and media for doing a remarkable job.</p>"

Their welfare should be looked after whilst they are onboard and in transit.\"     National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) General Secretary Abdulgani Serang said, \"I assured the minister that NUSI will certainly do the needful to financially support Indian seafarers in the current scenario when Indian economy is passing through a rough phase due to pandemic across the globe.\"           He said NUSI has earmarked a corpus of Rs 10 crore to support retired Indian seafarers, disabled seafarers, widows of seafarers and jobless seafarers who have been out of job for the past nine months.</p>\r\n<p>\"This novel move is aimed at alleviating their economic hardships in the current pandemic scenario,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>Mandaviya on Friday had exhorted port officials and other stakeholders to convert the present crisis into an opportunity by ensuring smooth cargo operations so that supplies are not hit during the lockdown.</p>\r\n<p>The representatives from ports sector had raised concerns on high port operation cost, port congestion, shortage of labourers, movement of workers and truck drivers, among others, due to the lockdown.</p>\r\n<p>ndia has 12 major portsmdash;Deendayal (erstwhile Kandla), Mumbai, JNPT, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (earlier Ennore), V.O.

            "<p><strong>Tribune News Service</strong><br /><strong>New Delhi, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>The country's largest paramilitary force, the Central Reserve Police Force, has advised 200 of its personnel to go on home quarantine, a source in the force said.</p>\r\n<p>Among those asked to go on self-quarantine is CRPF's Director-General AP Maheshwari, the source said.</p>\r\n<p>The decision, believed to be precautionary, was taken after the force drew up a detailed list of about 200 personnel, including the DG, after the CRPF's Chief Medical Officer tested positive for the virus. He was isolated, and eight other officers were quarantined, the source said.</p>\r\n<p>Liaison Officer and Assistant Commandant of CRPF, P Raja, who had been quarantined after Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak was tested Covid-19 positive, also underwent a test and awaited results.</p>\r\n<p>The 200 CRPF personnel sent on home quarantine were traced to be in contact with Raja and further course of measures will be taken after test reports of Raja, officials in the force said. </p>\r\n<p>A senior official in the force said that everyone on the list, including the CRPF DG and Senior Security Advisor of MHA K Vijay Kumar, have been advised home quarantine or quarantine at CRPF facilities until their test reports came back. The official said they have not shown any symptoms of being infected.</p>\r\n<p>At least three Inspectors General, whose wards returned from foreign countries, have also been quarantined as a precautionary measure, as has former CRPF DG Vikram Srivastava, sources said.</p>\r\n<p>The CRPF chief, who is subjected to home quarantine, is overseeing the force's work from home. Maheshwari has so far shown no symptoms, officials said.</p>\r\n<p>A CRPF spokesperson said: \"A CRPF officer has tested positive for COVID-19. All personnel in contact with the officer have been quarantined. The DG CRPF had an indirect contact with the officer. As per protocol, DG is observing quarantine\".</p>\r\n<p>\"We will win together. The only Mantra is social distancing. To all of us let this be the religion as well as spirituality of the day. Save oneself to save others. Save humanity,\" Maheshwari has tweeted tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PMO, HMOIndia and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>"

Rajkot is considered as an engineering hub. Small scale industries of Rajkot supply engineering parts to NASA, ISRO, Railways and for defence production, Rupani said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am happy to announce that an industrialist from Rajkot has been successful in manufacturing ventilators in just 10 days. They designed it, made a prototype, procured parts and successfully built ventilators. Their testing has been done and certification has been completed. It is being used on patients from Saturday,\" he told reporters.</p>\r\n<p>Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who is also Gujarat's health minister, said the company, Jyoti CNC Automation Limited, has not only passed engineering requirements for the machine but also successfully cleared medical requirements at the testing lab.</p>\r\n<p>\"Chief Minister Rupani took special interest and invited industries to come forward and help to fight this global threat. He did regular follow-ups with the industry and assured and provided all help so that ventilators can be indigenously manufactured,\" Patel said.</p>\r\n<p>Jyoti CNC has decided to donate first 1,000 ventilators to the Gujarat government, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The company's owner Prakaramsinh Jadeja said they were given the task which was difficult to achieve in this period of lockdown.</p>\r\n<p>\"A team of nearly 150 people has been working day and night for last 10 days to develop a 'Made in India' ventilator. Due to the lockdown and ban on international travel and goods movement, we cannot procure any parts from abroad. So we procured the ventilator parts from 26 different companies in India, Jadeja said.</p>\r\n<p>The ventilator developed by the company has been named as 'Dhaman 1', which is the base model and fulfils the requirement of COVID-19 patients, he said, adding that later more advanced models will be developed.</p>\r\n<p>Jadeja said the market cost of a single ventilator is Rs 6.5 lakh, but they have been able to manufacture it at a cost below Rs 1 lakh.</p>\r\n<p>\"We will donate 1,000 ventilators to the Gujarat government. We have got the capacity of manufacturing 100 ventilators per day and after three days, we will ramp up the capacity as per the demand,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Many state governments are in touch with us and after providing ventilators to Gujarat, we will supply it to other states,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>Till Saturday, Gujarat reported 108 cases of coronavirus and 10 deaths.

            "<p><strong>Johannesburg, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>A South African Muslim cleric, who recently returned from India after attending the Nizamuddin congregation, has died after contracting the novel coronavirus, according to his family members.</p>\r\n<p>Moulana Yusuf Tootla, 80, attended the March 1-15 Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the Nizmuddin area, that has emerged as the epicentre for the spread of the coronavirus in different parts of India and abroad after thousands of people took part in it.</p>\r\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/o4FXTDbsxyc\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Tootla, who died on Tuesday, was buried after his body was collected in a bag by the Islamic Burial Council (IBC).</p>\r\n<p>The Nizamuddin area is famed for the shrine of the 14h century Sufi mystic Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya.</p>\r\n<p>Indian authorities have launched a nationwide search for participants of the huge religious gathering amid fears that thousands present there could have carried the infection to the length and breadth of the country.</p>\r\n<p>Various nationals, particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan come for Tabligh activities in Delhi.</p>\r\n<p>A family member of the cleric, on the basis of anonymity, told local media that Tootla began showing flu-like symptoms on his return from India.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequent tests at a private facility revealed that he had the virus.</p>\r\n<p>\"By the past weekend Tootla had almost fully recovered from his treatment, but by Monday morning he started feeling ill again.</p>\r\n<p>\"His condition deteriorated rapidly,\" the family member said.</p>\r\n<p>Tootla was reportedly advised not to travel to India for the gathering, but he was adamant to go.</p>\r\n<p>He had participated in scores of similar gatherings across the globe, according to fellow clerics, but none of whom could confirm if other South Africans had also attended.</p>\r\n<p>\"He (Tootla) said his fate is in Allah's hands, as He (God) had already decided when he would recall him,\" said the family member.</p>\r\n<p>Tootla's extended family is in self-isolation for 14 days, although none of them have tested positive for the virus.</p>\r\n<p>IBC chairperson Salim Kazi said small adjustments were made for Muslim burials to ensure compliance with the government guidelines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown which is now in its 8th day.</p>\r\n<p>The guidelines restrict the number of people who can attend a funeral, so hundreds of people who had known the Islamic leader had to be advised to offer prayers for him in their homes.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, South Africa has 1,585 COVID-19 cases and nine people have died of the disease in the country.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, majority of the people who tested positive for the disease in New Delhi are those who took part in the religious congregation.</p>\r\n<p>According to Delhi's Health Department, 301 patients out of the 445 cases in the state are those participated in the Tablighi Jamaat, and Chief Minister Kejriwal said that the number of cases could spike as all 2,300 people evacuated from the Tablighi's 'markaz' were being tested. mdash;PTI</p>\r\n<p> </p>"

            "<p><strong>Vijay Mohan</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tribune News Service</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Chandigarh, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>From evaluating the technical parameters of missiles and explosives, Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) here has switched its expertise and in-house innovation to develop personal protective gear for the medical fraternity in the nationwide fight against COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>As many as 10,000 full face protective shields and 15 acrylic enclosures for examining infected persons are being produced by TBRL for the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education (PGIMER) here.</p>\r\n<p>\"The face shields are single use as well as multiple use type while the lntubation protective enclosure can be used multiple times,\" Dr Manjit Singh, Director TBRL said. \"We are making about a 100 face shields and 3-4 enclosures each day,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>An important Defence Research and Development Organisaltion (DRDO) establishment based in Chandigarh, TBRL is involved in development, production, processing and characterisation of different high explosive compositions, fragmentation studies of warheads, captive flight testing of bombs, missiles and airborne systems and ballistics evaluation of protective system like body armour, vehicle armour and helmets.</p>\r\n<p>The face shields are light weight and can be worn full day with comfort. Commonly available A-4 size transparency sheets used in overhead projectors are being used as visors while the holding frame is manufactured through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), commonly known as 3-D printing. Polylactic Acid filament, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane, was used for 3-D printing.</p>\r\n<p>The enclosures were requested by PGIMER's Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care to act as first level of protection for doctors and medical staff during the intubation of COVID-19 patients. This is a process in which a tube is inserted into the patient's mouth to keep the airway open so that the patient can be placed on a ventilator.</p>\r\n<p>Made of perspex sheets the transparent enclosure is a cuboid that covers the patient's face and upper chest, with two holes on one side through which a doctor has insert his arms to work. Medical professionals are at elevated levels of risk of infection as virus particles can become aerosolised during intubation.</p>\r\n<p>Mass production of the products is planned using injection moulding technique to expedite the process. Industrial partners are also being developed to meet the possible demands from neighbouring states. Being a research laboratory, in-house production in TBRL is limited.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Manjit said that TBRL is also making hand sanitizers for the Chandigarh Police using base compositions developed by the DRDO. The requirement is for 6,000 bottles of 500 ml and 1,200 bottles have already been supplied. TBRL was to get the sanitizers bottled from a commercial plant in Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, but the area has been sealed-off due to the death of an infected person. Alternate measures are being explored.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, TBRL is also acting as a facilitator for the procurement of bio-suits developed by another DRDO lab for use by health care service providers. A walk-through disinfection tunnel, which is placed at the entrance to a building or complex, is also being evaluated at TBRL. Developed by Research Center Imarat, Hyderabad, the tunnel is equipped with sensors to assess body parameters, air showers and disinfectant sprays. It has the potential of being deployed at any public place or office complex.</p>"

            "<p>Washington, April 5</p>\r\n<p>President Donald Trump has said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the Hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in the country after India recently banned the drug for exports.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he spoke to Prime Minister Modi on Saturday morning and made a request to release Hydroxycholoroquine mdash; an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria mdash; for the US.</p>\r\n<p>\"I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of Hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,\" Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.</p>\r\n<p>India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 25 banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine but said that certain shipments on humanitarian grounds may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\n<p>With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he would appreciate if India releases the amount of Hydroxychloroquine that the US has ordered.</p>\r\n<p>\"And I said I would appreciate if they (India) would release the amounts that we ordered,\" he said, without mentioning that quantity of Hydroxychloroquine that has been ordered by US companies from India.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists across the world are racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus that has so far killed more than 64,000 people and infected 1.2 million in more than 150 countries.</p>\r\n<p>Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Following a quick provisional approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Saturday, the malaria drug along with a combination of some other drug is being used in the treatment of about 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York, the epicentre in the US.</p>\r\n<p>According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.</p>\r\n<p>In the next several weeks, health experts in the US have projected between 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, which due to human-to-human transmission is spreading like a wildfire in the country.</p>\r\n<p>In anticipation of it being a successful drug in the treatment of coronavirus, the US has already stockpiled some 29 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine.</p>\r\n<p>It is in this context Trump requested Modi to help US get millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that can be produced at mass scale in India.</p>\r\n<p>Prime Minister Modi on Saturday said he held a detailed discussion on the coronavirus crisis with President Trump and resolved to deploy the full strength of the Indo-US partnership to fight the global pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had a good discussion and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight COVID-19,\" Modi wrote on Twitter on his \"extensive\" telephonic conversation with Trump.</p>\r\n<p>The prime minister and the US president exchanged views on the pandemic and its impact on the global well-being and economy, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.</p>\r\n<p>Stressing on the special relationship between the two countries, Modi reiterated India's solidarity with the US in overcoming this global crisis together.</p>\r\n<p>\"The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19,\" the PMO said.</p>\r\n<p>Modi and Trump also exchanged notes on the steps taken in their countries for mitigating the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The two leaders also touched upon the significance of practices such as yoga and ayurveda for ensuring physical and mental well-being in these difficult times, the PMO statement said.</p>\r\n<p>They agreed that their officials would remain in close touch as regards the global health crisis, it added.</p>\r\n<p>Modi also conveyed deep condolences for the loss of lives in the US and his prayers for an early recovery of those still suffering from the disease.</p>\r\n<p>The discussion came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>\r\n<p>The Trump administration has made Hydroxychloroquine as part of its Strategic National Stockpile.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that people in malaria affected-countries take Hydroxychloroquine and not many people are infected by coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that he would take Hydroxychloroquine, if needed.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think people should if it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it, Ok? I may take it. And, I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it,\" he said in response to a question. PTI</p>"

            "<p>Jaipur: A Rajasthan cop has innovated a full body walk-in sanitising chamber for Covid-19 warriors, including medics, cops and others.

It is suggested that people not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house and especially if they live in densely populated areas. This face cover is not recommended for either health workers or those working with or in contact with Covid-19 patients or patients themselves as these categories of people are required to wear specified protective gear like N95 masks,\" said the advisory.</p>\r\n<p>Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said the advisory was for homemade covers not masks.</p>\r\n<p>\"Our old guidelines on masks are intact. Medical masks are to be used only by health workers and people caring for Covid-19 patients. Other people in densely populated communities should use homemade face and mouth covers. Every family member should use a different cover,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>The advisory asks people to arrange two sets of face covers so that one can be washed while the other is used.</p>\r\n<p>\"Hand washing will still remain essential criteria and hands should be washed before wearing the face cover. Such face covers should not be thrown anywhere but kept safely, washed properly with soap and hot water and dried properly before they are used. These face covers could be made out of clean cloth available at home, which needs to be thoroughly cleaned and washed before a face cover is stitched or made,\" the advisory said.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Self-help groups make over 132 lakh masks</strong></p>\r\n<p>New Delhi: Self-helf groups from 24 states, under the Union Rural Development Ministry's National Rural Livelihood Mission, have made over 132 lakh face masks. In all, 14,522 SHGs, comprising 65,936 members, took up the task, the ministry said. Over 2 lakh masks were made in Punjab and over 1 lakh in Haryana. TNS</p>"

But active job card holders are those who have been seeking work and coming to work under MGNREGA over the past two years.</p>\r\n<p>The petition contended that the March 24 lockdown order issued under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 was binding on all ministries/instrumentalities of the Central and state governments and only essential services were exempt from it.</p>\r\n<p>As it required all citizens to follow social and physical distancing and didn't exempt works performed under MGNREGA, it was not possible for MGNREGA card holders to work and earn livelihood, the petition submitted.</p>\r\n<p>It urged the top court to direct that \"at least all active job card holders under MGNREGA over the past one year will be deemed to be on duty during the 21-day lockdown period and accordingly direct them to make payment of wages without deductions urgently.\" The petition is likely to come up for hearing early next week.</p>\r\n<p>Describing MGNREGA as a programme meant to be a lifeline to rural workers during this kind of distress circumstances, the petitioners said, \"It would be completely unfair to not enable MGNREGA to provide the support that it is designed to give when rural workers are facing the country's worst challenge of unemployment and limited access to money and foodgrains.\"</p>"

            "<p>Tribune News Service</p>\r\n<p>New Delhi, April 4</p>\r\n<p>As thousands of people die of Covid-19 across the globe, the International Council of Jurists (ICJ) and All India Bar Association (AIBA) have moved the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) seeking compensation from China from where the deadly coronavirus is said to have originated. ICJ and AIBA accused Beijing of \"surreptitiously developing a biological weapon capable of mass destruction.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It's a crime against humanity. China has deliberately concealed crucial information about coronavirus,\" ICJ Chairman and AIBA president Adish C Aggarwala said.</p>\r\n<p>\"It is humbly prayed that the UNHRC may be pleased to enquire and direct China and to adequately compensate international community and member states, particularly India, for surreptitiously developing a biological weapon capable of mass destruction of mankind,\" the complaint stated.</p>\r\n<p>The virus was developed in the Wuhan Virology Lab from where it was carefully deployed to affect a miniscule 0.001 per cent of the Chinese population, the complaint alleged.</p>\r\n<p>Aggarwala alleged that China used the coronavirus with a view to control the economy of the world by buying up stocks from countries that are now on the brink of economic collapse. He demanded compensation from China.</p>"

            "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Melbourne, April 4</span></p>\r\n<p>Researchers have found that an anti-parasitic drug, already available around the world, can kill the novel coronavirus grown in cell cultures within 48 hours, an advance that may lead to the development and trial of a new clinical therapy for Covid-19. Published in the journal Antiviral Research, the study, conducted by senior scientists, stated drug Ivermectin stopped the virus from growing.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Trials yet to be conducted on people</span></p>\r\n<p>Published in the journal Antiviral Research, the study states the drug, Ivermectin, stops the virus from growing. \"A single dose can essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours,\" says study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia. He cautions that trials are yet to be conducted on people.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\"We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,\" said study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia. The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus. However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out on people.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that's the next step,\" Wagstaff said. \"In times when we're having a global pandemic and there isn't an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus 'dampening down' the host cells' ability to clear it. \"As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,\" said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. mdash; PTI</p>"

            "<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Washington, April 4</span></p>\r\n<p>The US recorded the worst 24-hour death toll globally since the Covid-19 pandemic began as nearly 1,500 deaths were reported between Thursday and Friday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. With 1,480 deaths counted between 8:30 pm on Thursday and the same time on Friday, according to the university's continuously updated figures, the total number of people who have died so far in the US is now 7,896.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">People should cover their faces with scarves or cloth masks when they leave their homes as part of the efforts to curb the spread of the pandemic in the country, US President Donald Trump has said.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>New York State remained the epicentre of Covid in US as it reported the highest number of 562 deaths in a single day. With a person dying almost every two-and-a-half minutes Governor Andrew Cuomo allowed redistribution of ventilators and protective gear to hospitals with greater need.</p>\r\n<p>Coronavirus cases in the state crossed 1,00,000 as the death toll now stands at 2,935. \"The curve continues to go up,\" Cuomo said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state now stands at 102,863, nearly half of all COVID-19 infections in the US, where the tally has reached 2,90,947. New York City alone has 56,289 coronavirus patients.</p>\r\n<p>Cuomo also gave a grim assessment of the rising number of casualties, saying the state witnessed the \"highest single increase in the number of deaths since we started.\" The Governor also expressed anger over the short supply of essential medical equipment for healthcare professionals to help them deal with the surge in the cases across the state and the country.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, US hospitals desperate to help very sick patients with COVID-19 are trying a treatment first used in the 1890s that relies on blood plasma donated by recovered patients. People who survive an infectious disease like COVID-19 are generally left with blood containing antibodies, or proteins made by the body's immune system to fight off a virus. The blood component that carries the antibodies can be collected and given to newly infected patients - it is known as \"convalescent plasma.\"mdash; Agencies</p>"

            "<p>New York, April 5</p>\r\n<p>In the days after China made the disclosure about its coronavirus outbreak, nearly 430,000 people arrived in the US on direct flights from the country, including thousands who travelled directly from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, a report in The New York Times said.</p>\r\n<p>Over 1,300 direct flights from China to 17 US cities brought back hundreds of thousands of people before President Donald Trump imposed travel restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>\"Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia-like illness to international health officials on New Year's eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel, according to an analysis of data collected in both countries,\" the report said.</p>\r\n<p>It added that testing at the airports and follow-ups with travellers coming from China was not stringent enough.</p>\r\n<p>During the first half of January, when Chinese officials were underplaying the severity of the outbreak, no travellers from China were screened for potential exposure to the virus.</p>\r\n<p>Health screening began in mid-January, but only for a number of travellers who had been in Wuhan and only at the airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, it said.</p>\r\n<p>\"By that time, about 4,000 people had already entered the US directly from Wuhan,\" the report quoted VariFlight, an aviation data company based in China.</p>\r\n<p>The bulk of the 4,30,000 passengers, who were of multiple nationalities, arrived in January at airports spread across the length and breadth of the US-Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Newark and Detroit.         </p>\r\n<p>\"Thousands of them flew directly from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, as American public health officials were only beginning to assess the risks to the US,\" the report said.</p>\r\n<p>According to estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases across the world, the highest being in the US (311,544) as of April 4. More than 64,000 people have died globally with 8,400 in the US.</p>\r\n<p>Even as severe restrictions on travel and movement of people were eventually put in place, flights continued this past week, with passengers travelling from Beijing to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, under rules that exempt Americans and some others from the clampdown that took effect on February 2.</p>\r\n<p>\"In all, 279 flights from China have arrived in the US since then, and screening procedures have been uneven,\" the report said.</p>\r\n<p>While President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that his travel measures impeded the virus' spread in the US and \"we're the ones that kept China out of here,\" the NYT report said analysis of the flight and other data shows the travel measures, however effective, may have come too late to have \"kept China out.\"  </p>\r\n<p>Given that health officials now believe that as many as 25 per cent of people infected with the virus may never show symptoms, infectious-disease experts suspect that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks after the first American case was confirmed in Washington State on January 20.</p>\r\n<p>\"In fact, no one knows when the virus first arrived in the US,\" it said.</p>\r\n<p>In January, before the broad screening was in place, there were over 1,300 direct passenger flights from China to the United States, according to VariFlight and two American firms, MyRadar and FlightAware.</p>\r\n<p>About 3,81,000 travellers flew directly from China to the United States that month, about a quarter of whom were American, according to data from the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration.</p>\r\n<p>Several passengers arrived from China after transiting through other countries. While actual passenger counts for indirect fliers were not available, Sofia Boza-Holman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said they represented about a quarter of travellers from China.</p>\r\n<p>The report also added that about 60 per cent of travellers on direct flights from China in February were not American citizens, according to the most recently available government data.</p>\r\n<p>\"Most of the flights were operated by Chinese airlines after American carriers halted theirs.\" PTI</p>"

            "<p><strong>Bangkok, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>A shutdown to contain the coronavirus has killed Thailand's party scene and forced sex workers like Pim out of bars and onto desolate streets. She's scared but desperately needs customers to pay her rent.</p>\r\n<p>Red-light districts from Bangkok to Pattaya have gone quiet with night clubs and massage parlours closed and tourists blocked from entering the country.</p>\r\n<p>That has left an estimated 300,000 sex workers out of a job, pressing some onto the streets where the risks are sharpened by the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm afraid of the virus but I need to find customers so I can pay for my room and food,\" Pim, a 32-year-old transgender sex worker, told AFP in an area of Bangkok where previously bawdy neon-lit bars and brothels have gone dark.</p>\r\n<p>Since Friday Thais have been under a 10 pm to 4 am curfew. Bars and eat-in restaurants closed several days earlier.</p>\r\n<p>Many of Bangkok's sex workers had jobs in the relative safety of bars, working for tips and willing to go home with customers.</p>\r\n<p>When their workplaces suddenly closed most returned home to wait out the crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Others like Pim went to work the streets.</p>\r\n<p>The government says it is ready to enforce a 24-hour curfew if necessary to control a virus that has infected more than 2,000 people and killed 20, according to official figures.</p>\r\n<p>Pim is paying a heavy price for the movement restrictionsmdash;she has not had a customer for 10 days and the bills are stacking up.</p>\r\n<p>Her friend Alice, another transgender sex worker, has also been forced to move from a go-go bar to the roadside.</p>\r\n<p>\"I used to make decent money sometimes $300-600 a week,\" Alice says.</p>\r\n<p>\"But when businesses shut down my income stopped too. We are doing this because we're poor. If we can't pay our hotel they will kick us out.\"    </p>\r\n<p>The occasional tourist loiters near clusters of sex workers, before a furtive negotiation and a quick march to a nearby hotel, one of the few still open on Bangkok's main tourist drag.</p>\r\n<p>The already high risks of sex work have rocketed as the virus spreads.</p>\r\n<p>Sex workers have flocked back to homes across the country in anticipation of several weeks of virtual lockdown before Thailand's night economy comes back to life.</p>\r\n<p>There are fears the malaise could last for months, yanking billions of tourist dollars from the economy and leaving those working in the informal sector destitute.</p>\r\n<p>They include sex workersmdash;an illegal but widely accepted part of Thailand's nightlife.</p>\r\n<p>There are concerns that a Thai government emergency scheme to give 5,000 baht (USD 150) to millions of newly jobless over the next three months will exclude sex workers because they cannot prove formal employment.</p>\r\n<p>The Empower Foundation, an advocacy group for the kingdom's sex workers, says entertainment venues make around $6.4 billion a year, many of them selling sex in some form.</p>\r\n<p>Women are suffering the most from the virus measures, it says. Many are mothers and their family's main income earner, forced into sex work by lack of opportunities or low graduate salaries.</p>\r\n<p>The group has written an open letter to the government urging it to \"find a way to provide assistance to all workers who have lost their earnings\".</p>\r\n<p>As the 10 pm curfew looms, Pim and Alice prepare for a final forlorn patrol for customers.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think the government has been really slow. They don't care about people like us who work in the sex industry,\" Alice said.</p>\r\n<p>\"We're more afraid of having nothing to eat than the virus.\" mdash; AFP</p>"

            "<p><strong>Johannesburg, April 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>A South African Muslim cleric, who recently returned from India after attending the Nizamuddin congregation, has died after contracting the novel coronavirus, according to his family members.</p>\r\n<p>Moulana Yusuf Tootla, 80, attended the March 1-15 Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the Nizmuddin area, that has emerged as the epicentre for the spread of the coronavirus in different parts of India and abroad after thousands of people took part in it.</p>\r\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/o4FXTDbsxyc\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Tootla, who died on Tuesday, was buried after his body was collected in a bag by the Islamic Burial Council (IBC).</p>\r\n<p>The Nizamuddin area is famed for the shrine of the 14h century Sufi mystic Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya.</p>\r\n<p>Indian authorities have launched a nationwide search for participants of the huge religious gathering amid fears that thousands present there could have carried the infection to the length and breadth of the country.</p>\r\n<p>Various nationals, particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan come for Tabligh activities in Delhi.</p>\r\n<p>A family member of the cleric, on the basis of anonymity, told local media that Tootla began showing flu-like symptoms on his return from India.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequent tests at a private facility revealed that he had the virus.</p>\r\n<p>\"By the past weekend Tootla had almost fully recovered from his treatment, but by Monday morning he started feeling ill again.</p>\r\n<p>\"His condition deteriorated rapidly,\" the family member said.</p>\r\n<p>Tootla was reportedly advised not to travel to India for the gathering, but he was adamant to go.</p>\r\n<p>He had participated in scores of similar gatherings across the globe, according to fellow clerics, but none of whom could confirm if other South Africans had also attended.</p>\r\n<p>\"He (Tootla) said his fate is in Allah's hands, as He (God) had already decided when he would recall him,\" said the family member.</p>\r\n<p>Tootla's extended family is in self-isolation for 14 days, although none of them have tested positive for the virus.</p>\r\n<p>IBC chairperson Salim Kazi said small adjustments were made for Muslim burials to ensure compliance with the government guidelines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown which is now in its 8th day.</p>\r\n<p>The guidelines restrict the number of people who can attend a funeral, so hundreds of people who had known the Islamic leader had to be advised to offer prayers for him in their homes.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, South Africa has 1,585 COVID-19 cases and nine people have died of the disease in the country.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, majority of the people who tested positive for the disease in New Delhi are those who took part in the religious congregation.</p>\r\n<p>According to Delhi's Health Department, 301 patients out of the 445 cases in the state are those participated in the Tablighi Jamaat, and Chief Minister Kejriwal said that the number of cases could spike as all 2,300 people evacuated from the Tablighi's 'markaz' were being tested. mdash;PTI</p>\r\n<p> </p>"

            "<p>London, April 4</p>\r\n<p>Keir Starmer, the former shadow Brexit Secretary, on Saturday emerged as the winner of a three-way race to replace Jeremy Corbyn as the Leader of the UK's Opposition Labour party.</p>\r\n<p>The 57-year-old was elected after he defeated Rebecca Long-Bailey and Indian-origin MP Lisa Nandy, who were a distant second and third respectively in a postal ballot of party members, trade unionists and registered supporters.</p>\r\n<p>In his video victory message, Sir Keir Starmer said his task was to \"lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and hope\".</p>\r\n<p>Starmer's election has been widely welcomed, including by the diaspora representative group Labour Friends of India (LFIN), which called on the new Opposition leader to work on rebuilding trust and stronger India-UK ties.</p>\r\n<p>Under Corbyn's leadership, diaspora groups in the UK had repeatedly spoken out against a perceived anti-India sentiment with the Opposition ranks, especially after the Labour party passed a resolution at its annual conference last year in favour of international intervention in Kashmir.</p>\r\n<p>The move is believed to have turned many British Indians away from the party during the December 2019 general election, which resulted in a massive Labour defeat.</p>\r\n<p>\"In these unprecedented and challenging times, it is more important than ever before that the Labour party plays its part by effectively holding the government to account. The Labour party must also make the changes necessary to win hearts, minds and trust of the British people, including that of the 1.5 million strong British Indian community,\" said Rajesh Agarwal, LFIN co-chair and London's Deputy Mayor for business as he welcomed Starmer's election.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Labour party is the natural party for British Indians but last few years have seen the relations strained. I hope the change in leadership is the beginning of a healing process and the party will be able to regain the trust of the British Indian community,\" he said, adding that the process would require time, effort and political will.</p>\r\n<p>\"The result today will bring unity to the Labour party, show the country we are a serious party of government in waiting and prepare to win the next general election,\" said Virendra Sharma, a veteran Indian-origin Labour MP who had expressed his disquiet at the perceived anti-India Kashmir resolution at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Starmer, who had been the frontrunner in the race since it opened for voting at the end of February, said he had been elected \"at a time like no other\" and promised to work \"constructively\" with the government to confront the pandemic and not engage in \"Opposition for Opposition's sake\".</p>\r\n<p>\"We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we'll challenge that and call that out,\" said the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in London, who had fought on a \"unity\" platform.</p>\r\n<p>The lawyer-turned-politician has previously led the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and served in Corbyn's top team for more than three years and was the face of the party's Brexit policy. Saturday's result was announced by email after plans for a public event in London were cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>\r\n<p>\"Congratulations to Keir and his team. We have been competitors in this contest but never opponents and he will have my full support in the challenges that lie ahead,\" said Nandy, the 40-year-old MP for Wigan in Greater Manchester who had made it to the shortlist with strong backing from the party's union base.</p>\r\n<p>\"A united and strong Labour Party could not be more important than at this moment. The road back to power is steep but it does not have to be long,\" said Nandy, the daughter of India-born academic Dipak Nandy and a British mother, who along with other candidates had halted active campaigning last month as the coronavirus pandemic gained momentum in the UK.</p>\r\n<p>Starmer won in the first round of voting under the preferential system, polling 275,780 votes and representing 56.2 per cent of the total vote share. Rebecca Long-Bailey came second with 135,218 votes ndash; or 27.6 per cent ndash; with Nandy in third with 79,597 votes or 16.2 per cent.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner has been elected deputy leader. She defeated four other candidates but the contest was much closer, going to a third round of voting as she beat fellow MPs Ian Murray, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan.</p>\r\n<p>As many as 114,000 new members who had joined since the December 2019 general election, when Labour suffered a bruising defeat with its lowest number of seats since 1935, voted alongside members of affiliated trades unions and groups for the postal ballot.</p>\r\n<p>Around 14,700 \"registered supporters\", who paid 25 pounds to take part on a one-off basis, were also part of the preferential voting system in which the candidates are ranked in order of preference.</p>\r\n<p>Jeremy Corbyn had announced he would step down as Labour leader in the wake of the disastrous election result last year which handed British Prime Minister Boris Johnson a landslide win. mdash; PTI</p>\r\n<p> </p>"

            "<p>Washington, April 5</p>\r\n<p>President Donald Trump has said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the Hydroxychloroquine tablets ordered by the US to treat the growing number of coronavirus patients in the country after India recently banned the drug for exports.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he spoke to Prime Minister Modi on Saturday morning and made a request to release Hydroxycholoroquine mdash; an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria mdash; for the US.</p>\r\n<p>\"I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of Hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,\" Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.</p>\r\n<p>India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 25 banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine but said that certain shipments on humanitarian grounds may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\n<p>With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said he would appreciate if India releases the amount of Hydroxychloroquine that the US has ordered.</p>\r\n<p>\"And I said I would appreciate if they (India) would release the amounts that we ordered,\" he said, without mentioning that quantity of Hydroxychloroquine that has been ordered by US companies from India.</p>\r\n<p>Scientists across the world are racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus that has so far killed more than 64,000 people and infected 1.2 million in more than 150 countries.</p>\r\n<p>Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Following a quick provisional approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Saturday, the malaria drug along with a combination of some other drug is being used in the treatment of about 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York, the epicentre in the US.</p>\r\n<p>According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.</p>\r\n<p>In the next several weeks, health experts in the US have projected between 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, which due to human-to-human transmission is spreading like a wildfire in the country.</p>\r\n<p>In anticipation of it being a successful drug in the treatment of coronavirus, the US has already stockpiled some 29 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine.</p>\r\n<p>It is in this context Trump requested Modi to help US get millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that can be produced at mass scale in India.</p>\r\n<p>Prime Minister Modi on Saturday said he held a detailed discussion on the coronavirus crisis with President Trump and resolved to deploy the full strength of the Indo-US partnership to fight the global pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had a good discussion and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight COVID-19,\" Modi wrote on Twitter on his \"extensive\" telephonic conversation with Trump.</p>\r\n<p>The prime minister and the US president exchanged views on the pandemic and its impact on the global well-being and economy, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.</p>\r\n<p>Stressing on the special relationship between the two countries, Modi reiterated India's solidarity with the US in overcoming this global crisis together.</p>\r\n<p>\"The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19,\" the PMO said.</p>\r\n<p>Modi and Trump also exchanged notes on the steps taken in their countries for mitigating the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The two leaders also touched upon the significance of practices such as yoga and ayurveda for ensuring physical and mental well-being in these difficult times, the PMO statement said.</p>\r\n<p>They agreed that their officials would remain in close touch as regards the global health crisis, it added.</p>\r\n<p>Modi also conveyed deep condolences for the loss of lives in the US and his prayers for an early recovery of those still suffering from the disease.</p>\r\n<p>The discussion came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>\r\n<p>The Trump administration has made Hydroxychloroquine as part of its Strategic National Stockpile.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that people in malaria affected-countries take Hydroxychloroquine and not many people are infected by coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said that he would take Hydroxychloroquine, if needed.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think people should if it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it, Ok? I may take it. And, I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it,\" he said in response to a question. PTI</p>"

            "<p>Paris, April 4</p>\r\n<p>A man went on the rampage with a knife in a town in southeastern France on Saturday, killing two people and wounding five in what President Emmanuel Macron called \"an odious act\".</p>\r\n<p>The reasons behind the attack remain unclear although Interior Minister Christophe Castaner spoke of the suspect's \"terrorist journey\".</p>\r\n<p>The assailant, understood to be a refugee from Sudan, was arrested after the attack in the town of Romans-sur-Isere.</p>\r\n<p>Armed with a knife, the suspect went into a tobacco shop where he attacked the owner, town mayor Marie-Helene Thoraval told AFP.</p>\r\n<p>\"His wife got involved and she was wounded as well,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>The assailant then went into a butcher's shop where he took another knife before heading to the town centre where he entered another store.</p>\r\n<p>\"He took a knife, jumped over the counter, and stabbed a customer, then ran away\", the shop owner Ludovic Breyton told AFP.</p>\r\n<p>\"My wife tried to help the victim but in vain.\" According to witnesses cited by the local radio station France Bleu Drome Ardeche, the attacker shouted \"Allah Akbar!\" as he attacked his victims.</p>\r\n<p>David Olivier Reverdy, assistant national secretary of the National Police Alliance union, said the assailant had called on police to kill him when they came to arrest him.</p>\r\n<p>\"All the ingredients of a terrorist act are there,\" he told BFMTV.</p>\r\n<p>Macron was quick to denounce the attack on Twitter.</p>\r\n<p>\"All the light will be shed on this odious act which casts a shadow over our country which has already been hit hard in recent weeks,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>France is in its third week of a lockdown aimed at stemming the spread of the deadly coronavirus.</p>\r\n<p>Castaner also condemned the attack when he visited the site.</p>\r\n<p>\"This morning, a man embarked on a terrorist journey,\" he said, adding that it would be the job of the National Counter-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) to determine whether the attacker was part of a group or acting alone. mdash; AFP</p>"

            "<p>Sandeep Dikshit</p>\r\n<p>Tribune News Service</p>\r\n<p>New Delhi, April 4</p>\r\n<p>India's enthusiasm to see China cornered at the UNSC on Covid may not materialise although the 15-member world's top body on security may well take it up for discussion, said well-placed sources.</p>\r\n<p>It is not as if the UNSC has not passed resolutions on an epidemic. But its two discussions on HIV and Ebola over the past two decades had no interest in finger pointing at a particular country.</p>\r\n<p>The first time UNSC met on an epidemic was in 2000 when it discussed the impact of HIV on peace and security in Africa. The resolution did specifically mention Sub-Saharan Africa, but that was in the context of focussing efforts on treatment, care and prevention. The second time in 2014, an emergency meeting on Ebola did not pose any problems because it was the leaders of the affected countries have who had sought a global response.</p>\r\n<p>There are two big obstacles on getting the UNSC to do the bidding of the three western UNSC permanent members ndash; France, UK and the US ndash; besides their security allies. First is that China as a full member like these three also carries considerable clout and IOUs that can be encashed to forestall a discussion. Among the permanent members it has Russia on its side to wield a veto. Among the non-permanent members ndash; if it ever came to that -- the West can claim full allegiance of Germany, Dominican Republic, Belgium, Estonia, Niger and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines while Indonesia, South Africa, Tunisia and Vietnam may take an independent stance, said the sources.</p>\r\n<p>The second obstacle is proving that Covid endangers peace and security in the world, which is the UNSC's charter. Sources recalled how difficult it was for India to get a relatively simple matter like Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar blacklisted by the UNSC because China was unconvinced that his case fell within the ambit of Resolution 1267 on Al Qaeda and ISIS. Trying to prove that China should take the fall for the spread of Covid is a much steeper mountain, they pointed out.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>"

            "<p>Barcelona, April 4</p>\r\n<p>An ambulance driver wearing a white protective gown enters a Barcelona hotel and announces the arrival of three new \"customers\"mdash;a trio of coronavirus patients discharged from hospital into luxury quarantine.</p>\r\n<p>\"Good morning! How are you? My name is Enrique Aranda and I am probably the first non health care worker you see in several days,\" says the director of the five-star Melia Sarria hotel, peering into the ambulance.</p>\r\n<p>It took just three days to convert the hotel, which features contemporary decor and bathrooms with marble finishing, into a clinic.</p>\r\n<p>\"Some patients arrive thinking that they were taken out of hospital to be left to die, many people are frightened. I try to make them forget all that,\" said Aranda, wearing mask and gloves.</p>\r\n<p>\"I don't let them out of the ambulance until I get a smile out of them. I want them to enter in another way, that they see that they aren't in a hospital anymore, it is a hotel.\"       </p>\r\n<p>Instead of arriving with a suitcase, the hotel's new clients carry bags containing just a few personal belongings and their medical report.</p>\r\n<p>They are not welcomed by bellhops, but by a team of nurses wearing green or blue gowns, gloves and face masks.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as patients enter, the nurses take their temperature, revise their medical reports and ask if they need to contact any family member while hotel employees assign them to a room.</p>\r\n<p>The government ordered all hotels to shut to fight the pandemic, which has so far claimed 10,935 lives in Spainmdash;the world's second-highest toll after Italy.</p>\r\n<p>Hotels across the country have been converted into medical care centres to free up beds in hospitals which have been flooded with COVID-19 cases.</p>\r\n<p>In the Madrid region, the hardest-hit area in Spain and the first to adopt the measure, there are now just over 700 patients in quarantine in hotels.</p>\r\n<p>In second-city Barcelona, hoteliers have made 2,500 beds available. The Melia Sarria opened to patients on March 29 and currently has 107 guests with 50 more expected each day until all 307 rooms are full.</p>\r\n<p>\"They are cases of people who are already OK, who have passed through the hospital and are in the final phase of their recovery here, in the hotel,\" said Gemma Fanlo, a nurse at the facility.</p>\r\n<p>Staff at a nearby health clinic work round the clock to monitor COVID-19 patients recovering in hotels or at home, either in person or virtually, while at the same time still treating people needing help for other ailments.</p>\r\n<p>\"Healthcare professionals are working longer hours, and are even working from home, to ensure no one is left untreated. We are working at full stretch,\" said Belen Enfedaque, care director of Barcelona's network of health care clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Catalonia's regional health minister Alba Verges said these workers were the \"containment line\" that is preventing admissions to already overloaded hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>Inside the hotel, contact between people is kept to a minimum. There is an elevator for staff and one for patients. The hallways are silent.</p>\r\n<p>Patients receive four meals a day, which are left outside their rooms. A staff member knocks on the door and the patient must count to five before opening it.</p>\r\n<p>Relatives of the patients cannot enter the hotel and most leave clothes or magazines, laptops or other devices for their loved ones with staff outside.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am bringing this bag for my wife's aunt, who was hospitalised with pneumonia and they have sent her here now,\" said a middle-aged man who declined to be named.</p>\r\n<p>\"She is doing OK. Her daughter not so much... she is in the intensive care unit but her mother still does not know.\" The conversion of the hotels into care facilities has given their staff, who would have been out of work otherwise, a boost.</p>\r\n<p>\"It's very moving, said Marga Carballo who is now in charge of the Melia Sarria hotel's reception.</p>\r\n<p>\"At home I felt bad watching all this without being able to help.\" mdash; AFP</p>"

            "<p><strong>Washington, April 4</strong></p>\r\n<p>US President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday that he is firing the inspector general of the US intelligence community who was involved in triggering an impeachment probe of the president last year.</p>\r\n<p>In a letter to key lawmakers, Trump said he planned to remove the official, Michael Atkinson, in 30 days, saying, \"it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"This is no longer the case with regard to this inspector general,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>A US official said Thomas Monheim, a career intelligence professional, would serve as acting inspector general for the time being.</p>\r\n<p>Atkinson, a Trump appointee, had determined that a whistleblower's report was credible in alleging Trump abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 US election for his political benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Atkinson was also concerned that Trump potentially exposed himself to \"serious national security and counter-intelligence risks\" when he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son during a July 25 phone call, according to a Justice Department legal opinion.</p>\r\n<p>After contentious, partisan hearings, the Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump but the Republican-led Senate acquitted him of the charges in early February.</p>\r\n<p>Democrats heaped criticism on Trump for firing Atkinson, particularly as the country reels from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"In the midst of a national emergency, it is unconscionable that the president is once again attempting to undermine the integrity of the intelligence community by firing yet another an intelligence official simply for doing his job,\" said Democratic Senator Mark Warner, ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

            "<p><strong>United Nations, April 4</strong></p>\r\n<p>UN General Assembly meetings scheduled for the months of April and May have been postponed in the wake of the \"rapidly evolving\" coronavirus pandemic, but there are no plans as yet to change the dates of the high-level annual UNGA session in September.</p>\r\n<p>Since COVID-19 emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, around 1.1 million people have fallen ill across the globe. Almost 60,000 people have died worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>The President of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (PGA), Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, has decided to postpone the UNGA meetings scheduled for April and May \"in light of the updated guidance severely limiting in-person meetings, as a result of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic,\" the PGA's office said on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Muhammad-Bande has decided to postpone the plenary meeting for the 75th anniversary of the end of the World War-II, scheduled for May 6; the high-level thematic debate, scheduled for May 11, to take stock of the progress on the impact of rapid technological change on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals; and the informal interactive dialogue on commodity markets, scheduled for May 22.</p>\r\n<p>All in-person meetings of the General Assembly mandated processes, scheduled to be held between April 17 and the end of May, also stand cancelled.</p>\r\n<p>Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, was asked at the daily press briefing on Thursday whether there were plans to cancel the high-level UN General Assembly session in September, particularly since the COP26 UN Climate Change conference set to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p>\"No, I'm not aware...no plans that I'm aware of. Obviously, the COP26 and the General Assembly high-level debate are two different things in the sense that the General Assembly takes place in a UN Headquarter station. Obviously, the level of representation and so forth will be decided by Member States. But at this point... there are no plans to change that calendar,\" Dujarric said.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier last month, as the number of coronavirus cases began to gradually soar across New York City, Dujarric had said that \"it is very likely\" that the COVID-19 situation \"will have an impact of some sort on the General Assembly, but I think it's too early to tell and to give any more details at this point\".</p>\r\n<p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York State now stand at 102,863, nearly half of all COVID-19 cases in the US, where the tally is now 245,658.</p>\r\n<p>New York City alone has 57,159 coronavirus patients. The state also witnessed the \"highest single increase in the number of deaths\" in a day on Thursday.</p>\r\n<p>The death toll in the state now stands at 2,935, an increase of 562 deaths in just one day. More than 6,000 people have died in the US -- 1,562 in New York City alone, according to Johns Hopkins University estimates. PTI</p>"

            "<p style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">United Nations, April 4</p>\r\n<p>The rapidly growing novel coronavirus pandemic is so far having little impact on the global food supply chain, but that could change for the worse ndash; and soon ndash; if anxiety-driven panic by major food importers takes hold, the World Food Programme (WFP) has said.</p>\r\n<p>In a new report, \"COVID-19: Potential impact on the world's poorest people: A WFP analysis of the economic and food security implications of the pandemic\", the UN agency said global markets for basic cereals are well-supplied and prices generally low.</p>\r\n<p>However, given the highly globalised nature of food production and supply, commodities need to move from the world's 'breadbaskets' to where they are consumed and the novel coronavirus-related containment measures are starting to make this more challenging.</p>\r\n<p>\"Disruptions are so far minimal; food supply is adequate, and markets are relatively stable,\" WFP Senior Spokesperson Elizabeth Byrs said, noting that global cereal stocks are at comfortable levels and the outlook for wheat and other staple crops is positive for the rest of the year.</p>\r\n<p>\"But we may soon expect to see disruptions in food supply chains,\" she said, explaining that if big importers lose confidence in the reliable flow of basic food commodities, panic buying could ensue, driving prices up.</p>\r\n<p>A grain market analyst at the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), quoted anonymously in the report, said the problem is not supply, but \"a behavioural change over food security\".</p>\r\n<p>\"What if bulk buyers think they can't get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis,\" the analyst said.</p>\r\n<p>For low-income countries, the consequences could be devastating, with long-term repercussions, with coping strategies coming at the expense of such essential services as health and education.</p>\r\n<p>It recalled that when a food price crisis struck in 2008, the world's poorest households ndash; which typically spend the largest share of income on food ndash; suffered disproportionately.</p>\r\n<p>Using the economic pillar of the Proteus food security indexmdash;and taking into account dependency on primary commodities such as fuel, ores and metals for export earningsmdash;the report said that countries in Africa and the Middle East are most vulnerable.</p>\r\n<p>Africa accounts for the majority of the almost 212 million people in the world who are chronically food insecure and the 95 million who live amidst acute food insecurity, the report said.</p>\r\n<p>Byrs said labour shortages could disrupt the production and processing of labour-intensive crops in particularly, especially in vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\r\n<p>Other potential sources of disruption include blockages along transport routes ndash; a particular concern for fresh produce ndash; and quarantine measures that could impede farmers' access to markets.</p>\r\n<p>Going forward, the WFP report said, it is essential to monitor food prices and markets, and to transparently disseminate information ndash; thus helping to strengthen government policies while also averting public panic, and social unrest.</p>\r\n<p>It said that in places where food insecurity is caused by restricted access, rather than lack of availability, cash-based transfersmdash;which can often be made through contactless solutionsmdash;should be considered as a standard response.</p>\r\n<p>\"Planning in-kind food assistance is essential,\" the report said, noting that supply chain disruptions are likely to affect higher-value items first.</p>\r\n<p>Such items involve more tiers of suppliers, human interaction and dependency on few suppliers ndash; putting specialized nutritious food more at risk than staples, it said.

            "<p>Washington/Geneva, April 4</p>\r\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has brought the global economy to a standstill and plunged the world into a recession that will be \"way worse\" than the global financial crisis a decade ago, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Friday, calling it \"humanity's darkest hour.\"</p>\r\n<p>The IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, speaking at a rare joint news conference with the leader of the World Health Organisation (WHO), called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impact of the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is a crisis like no other,\" she told some 400 reporters on a video conference call. \"We have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession.</p>\r\n<p>\"It is way worse than the global financial crisis\" of 2008-2009.</p>\r\n<p>World Bank President David Malpass echoed her outlook in a post on LinkedIn, writing, \"Beyond the health impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are expecting a major global recession.\" More than 1 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and more than 53,000 have died, a Reuters tally showed on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Georgieva said the IMF was working with the World Bank and WHO to advance their call for China and other official bilateral creditors to suspend debt collections from the poorest countries for at least a year until the pandemic subsides.</p>\r\n<p>She said China had engaged \"constructively\" on the issue, and the IMF would work on a specific proposal in coming weeks with the Paris Club of creditor nations, the Group of 20 major economies and the World Bank for review at the annual Spring Meetings, which will be held online in about two weeks.</p>\r\n<p>In his posting, Malpass said a debt standstill could begin on May 1, providing added liquidity for the poorest countries as they battle the disease. During the suspension period, he said, the World Bank and the IMF could evaluate the sustainability of those countries' debt and the possible need for a debt reduction by official creditors and commercial creditors.</p>\r\n<p>'Humanity's darkest hour'</p>\r\n<p>Emerging markets and developing economies have been hard hit by the crisis, Georgieva said, noting that nearly $90 billion in investments had already flowed out of emerging markets, far more than during the financial crisis. Some countries are also suffering from sharp drops in commodity prices.</p>\r\n<p>More than 90 countries -- nearly half the IMF's 189 members -- have asked for emergency funding from the IMF to respond to the pandemic, she said.</p>\r\n<p>The IMF and WHO have called for emergency aid to be used mainly to strengthen health systems, pay doctors and nurses, and buy protective gear.</p>\r\n<p>Georgieva said the IMF stood ready to use as much of its \"war chest\" of $1 trillion in financing capability as needed.</p>\r\n<p>The IMF has begun disbursing funds to requesting countries, including Rwanda, with requests from two additional African nations to be reviewed on Friday, she said.</p>\r\n<p>\"This is, in my lifetime, humanity's darkest hour - a big threat to the whole world - and it requires from us to stand tall, be united, and protect the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p>She said central banks and finance ministers had already taken unprecedented steps to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and stabilize markets, but more work was needed to keep liquidity flowing, especially to emerging markets.</p>\r\n<p>To that end, the IMF's board in coming days would review a proposal to create a new short-term liquidity line to help provide funds to countries facing problems. Georgieva also urged central banks and particularly the US Federal Reserve to continue offering swap lines to emerging economies. Reuters</p>"

Those needs to be used for medical people working to save lives of Americans. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the front-line healthcare workers who are performing those vital services,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>CDC has recommended that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric masks that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.</p>\r\n<p>However, Trump said he will not follow that guidance.</p>\r\n<p>\"I just don't want to wear one myself, it's a recommendation,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, dictators, kings, queens, I don't know, I don't see it for myself,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>The deadly coronavirus has so far claimed over 7,000 lives in the US and infected over 2,70,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>During the press conference, Trump stressed that the new masks guidelines do not replace CDC's guidance on social distancing, including staying at home when possible, standing at least 6 feet apart for a period of time.</p>\r\n<p>He also called for practicing hand hygiene.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the new available data, CDC said the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity--for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing--even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.

            "<p>Washington, April 3</p>\r\n<p>Researchers have tested a potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, which when delivered through a fingertip-sized patch, produced an immune response specific to the novel coronavirus at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralising the virus.</p>\r\n<p>The study, published in the journal 'EBioMedicine', noted that when tested in mice, the PittCoVacc mdash; short for Pittsburgh Coronavirus Vaccine mdash; generated a surge of antibodies against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, within two weeks of delivering it.</p>\r\n<p>\"We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus,\" said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto from the University of Pittsburgh in the US. \"We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,\" Gambotto added.</p>\r\n<p>The scientists said, the vaccine described in the current study follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity. They said it works the same way as current flu shots.</p>\r\n<p>The researchers also used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. They said this array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. According to the scientists, the patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles, made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces, simply dissolve into the skin.</p>\r\n<p>\"We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,\" said co-author Louis Falo from the University of Pittsburgh.mdash; PTI</p>"

This allows them to plan and deploy their resources in the best possible way,\" said Mads Nielsen from University of Copenhagen in Denmark.</p>\r\n<p>According to the researchers, algorithms will harvest vast amounts of data from multiple sources.</p>\r\n<p>The data consists of X-rays, tests and measurements taken of patients at the time of their admittance to the hospital, along with their electronic health records.</p>\r\n<p>\"All data will go to a supercomputer where, within minutes, our model calculates how likely a specific patient is to require a ventilator, and how many days will go by before such a need arises. That's our goal,\" Nielsen said.</p>\r\n<p>Although the models will not be used as a basis for treating individual patients, they will be used as a planning tool that can still make a big difference for hospital staff.</p>\r\n<p>In doing so, doctors hope to identify shared traits among the most severely affected patients. This may turn out to be the number of white blood cells, the use of certain pharmaceuticals or something else.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers said they are aware of certain things that increase risk, such as age, smoking, asthma and heart problems, but there are other factors involved.</p>\r\n<p>\"After all, we hear about young people who end up on ventilators and older people who do well without understanding why. So let's get the computer to find patterns that we aren't able to see,\" explained Espen Solem, Chief Physician, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospitals. These patterns will be compared with information from newly hospitalised patients.</p>\r\n<p>\"We hope that our models will be able to be used during this initial wave of infections, otherwise, they will be beneficial during the second wave that we anticipate in autumn,\" Nielsen noted. mdash;IANS</p>"

            "<p>Madrid, April 3</p>\r\n<p>The number of confirmed coronavirus deaths accelerated past 55,000 on Friday. The human scale of the pandemic has never been more stark mdash; experts warning that more than one million cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed globally is probably only a small proportion of total infections as testing is still not widely available.</p>\r\n<p>The US already accounts for around a quarter of confirmed cases, but Europe is far from being out of danger mdash; Spain reported more than 900 deaths in 24 hours on Friday, for the second day running. While Italy still leads the world in fatalities, France, Belgium and Britain have also been hard hit. The UK government opened a 4,000-bed field hospital on Friday after a one-day toll of 569.</p>\r\n<p>The world economy has been pummelled and the associated lockdowns, with more than half the population of the planet under some kind of lockdown. The US economy shed 7,01,000 jobs last month, its worst since March 2009, boosting the jobless rate to 4.4 percent for the first time in 45 years. mdash;Agencies</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">UK</span> PM continues self-isolation</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>London: British PM Boris Johnson said he will have to stay in extended self-isolation as he gave his health update via social media, which should have marked the end of the stipulated seven-day self-isolation period. Meanwhile, the UK reported a record 684 new deaths, as the number of confirmed cases climbed by 4,450 in 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Peru</span> limits movement by gender</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Lima: Peru has begun enforcing strict new measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease, restricting public movement by gender, a media report said on Friday. Men can only leave home on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; women can do so on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. On Sundays, no-one is allowed out. President Martin Vizcarra said previous control measures gave good results \"but not what was hoped for\".</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Spain</span> overtakes Italy in covid cases, death rate slows</strong></p>\r\n<p>Madrid: More than 900 persons died in Spain in 24 hours for the second day running, government figures showed on Friday, although the rate of new infections and deaths continued to slow. Spain has the world's second-highest death toll after Italy with the virus so far claiming 10,935 lives -- 932 in the past day -- from 1,17,710 confirmed cases. But health ministry figures confirm a consistent downward trend in the rate of new cases and fatalities.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\">Iran</span> toll 3,294 after 134 more succumb</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Iran announced 134 more deaths from the virus, bringing the officially confirmed total to 3,294. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said that 2,715 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 53,183.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\">Singapore</span> closes workplaces, schools</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Singapore will close schools and most workplaces for a month as part of stricter measures to curb infections. The city-state has won international praise for its two-month long battle. But authorities said record jumps in new infections this week, taking its total to 1,114 cases, pointed to the need for a tougher approach.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\">US</span> Cleanup of N-waste takes a back seat</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Covid pandemic has made the US government's efforts to clean up the Cold War-era waste from nuclear research and bomb making at federal sites around the country that has lumbered along for decades more challenging. The operations have taken a back seat to keep the workers safe.</p>"

            "<p>LONDON/WASHINGTON, April 3</p>\r\n<p>Carbon dioxide emissions could fall by the largest amount since World War Two this year as the coronavirus outbreak brings economies to a virtual standstill, according to the chair of a network of scientists providing benchmark emissions data.</p>\r\n<p>Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, which produces widely-watched annual emissions estimates, said carbon output could fall by more than 5% year-on-year -- the first dip since a 1.4 per cent reduction after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>\r\n<p>\"I wouldn't be shocked to see a 5 per cent or more drop in carbon dioxide emissions this year, something not seen since the end of World War Two,\" Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford University in California said.</p>\r\n<p>\"Neither the fall of the Soviet Union nor the various oil or savings and loan crises of the past 50 years are likely to have affected emissions the way this crisis is,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>The prediction ndash; among a range of new forecasts being produced by climate researchers - represents a tiny sliver of good news in the midst of crisis: Climate scientists had warned world governments that global emissions must start dropping by 2020 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>\r\n<p>But the improvements are for all the wrong reasons, tied to a world-shaking global health emergency that has infected more than 950,000 people - while shuttering factories, grounding airlines and forcing hundreds of millions of people to stay at home to slow the contagion.</p>\r\n<p>Experts warn that without structural change, the emissions declines caused by coronavirus could be short-lived and have little impact on the concentrations of carbon dioxide that have accumulated in the atmosphere over decades. mdash;Reuters</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #e74c3c;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Long-term uncertainty</span></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>The data suggest that the unprecedented global disruption caused by the pandemic is likely causing a sharp, brief drop in carbon emissions across some of the world's largest economies. While it's difficult to say how soon those economies will rebound mdash;it will depend, first and foremost, on the effectiveness of nations' COVID-19 responsesmdash;on a global scale, the pandemic may have already left its mark on 2020's carbon Bill.</p>"
